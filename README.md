# Research Proposal: The New Age of Collusion? An Empirical Study into Airbnb’s Pricing Dynamics and Market Behavior

## Abstract
This research aims to empirically investigate the influence of algorithmic pricing tools on Airbnb hosts' pricing strategies. The study will focus on how these digital tools impact market behavior, potentially blurring the line between market efficiency and tacit collusion. Using Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and Propensity Score Matching (PSM), the research will scrutinize the causal effects of Airbnb's pricing tools on hosts with varying operational strategies.

## 1. Introduction
### Background
In the digital economy, algorithmic pricing has revolutionized traditional business operations and competition models. This study focuses on Airbnb's marketplace, a prime example of digital transformation in market dynamics.

### Research Problem
The main concern is the potential shift towards algorithmic collusion facilitated by automated pricing tools in digital marketplaces, especially in the context of Airbnb's new pricing tool. The study will delve into the antitrust and anti-competitive aspects of these developments.

## 2. Literature Review
A synthesis of insights from existing literature on digitalization, market transparency, algorithmic pricing, and its impact on market competition and collusion.

## 3. Research Questions
The study focuses on several key questions:
1. Correlation between market interaction frequency and pricing strategies.
2. Behavioral impact of Airbnb’s new pricing tool.
3. Utilization of Airbnb’s pricing tool and its impact on hosts’ pricing decisions.
4. New pricing tool and host size dynamics in Airbnb.
5. New pricing tool impact on new vs. established hosts in Airbnb.
6. Changes in listing characteristics post-policy implementation.
7. Assessing anti-competitive behavior and market dynamics.
8. Implications for antitrust analysis and market regulation.

## 4. Methodology
### Data Collection and Description
Detailed data collection from 35 cities across the United States, focusing on daily price decisions, availability, minimum stay requirements, and host characteristics.

### Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)
Utilizing RDD to establish a causal relationship between the introduction of Airbnb’s pricing tool and changes in hosts’ pricing strategies.

### Propensity Score Matching (PSM)
Employing PSM to pair listings in the treatment group with similar listings in the control group, enhancing the precision of the analysis.

## 5. Expected Outcomes and Implications
The study aims to provide insights into:
- Algorithmic pricing and market dynamics.
- Evidence of tacit collusion.
- Comparative analysis of hosts who adopt the pricing tool and those who do not.
- Policy implications for competition policy in digital marketplaces.

## 6. Potential Limitations and Future Research Directions
Acknowledging limitations in data collection, scope, and methodology, the proposal outlines future research directions, including the use of high-frequency data, long-term impact analysis, and expanding methodological approaches.

## 7. Conclusion
This research seeks to offer vital insights into the role of digital tools in shaping competitive dynamics in online marketplaces like Airbnb, highlighting the balance between market efficiency and the risk of collusion.
